<li id="first-id" class="first-class" draggable>

li {colour:blue;} - Element
.first-class {color:red;} - Class (can have multiple different Elements with this class, so more specific, but not most.)
li[draggable] {color: purple;} - Attribute (Similar to Class but slightly more specific)
#first-id {color: orange;} - ID - Most specific as you should only have one element with one perticular id name.

External - Least specific - can be applied to many different webpages
Internal - Middle specific - only for one webpage
Inline - Most specific - Only for that one element.
If all three of the above targetted the same element, the inline one would be the one to work.

color: red;
color: green !important; - This important keyword forces this to be the style that is taken.

Position
Specificity
Type
Important
From bottom to top is the order in which things will be applied. E.g. Position is less relevant than Specificity.

You can chain selectors.
Selector > selector - Direct decendent of first selector
Selector selector - Finding any decendent of a given ancestor
SelectorSelector - Finding a specific combination of elements/classes/IDs


------------------------

CSS Positions
-Static Positioning:
    HTML default flow.

-Relative Positioning:
    The items position relative to it's default position.

Absolute Positioning:
    The position relative to the nearest positioned ancestor or top left corner of the webpage.

Each item has a z index which is it's position in the z axis.

Fixed Position:
    -Position relative to the top left corner of the BROWSER window. That way when you scroll it stays in the same location.
