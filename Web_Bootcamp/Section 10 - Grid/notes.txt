grid-template-rows: 100px auto - This will mean the first row is 100px, the second will fit to the size of the content.
grid-template-columns: 200px auto - This will mean the first column is 200px, the second will fit to fill the rest of the whole 100% screen.

For the above, we can us fr, which is the fractional size. E.g:
grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr - With this the second row will always be double the size of the first.

grid-template-columns: 200px minmax(400px,800px) - This says the first column is 200px wide, the second column can be anywhere between 400 and 800px.

grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 100px) - This says we have 2 columns at 100px each.

grid-auto-rows: 300px - This is used to set the size for any additional rows (or columns) that are added that are not already defined.
