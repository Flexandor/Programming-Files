CSS - Cascading Style Sheet
HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language
Sass - Syntactically Awesome Style Sheet
Less - Leaner Style Sheet

Leave styling for the CSS and leave the content in the HTML.

Inline CSS:
<html style="background: blue"></html>
The style attribute goes inside the openening tag for HTML

Internal CSS:
This is done through a special HTML <style> tag.
Eg:
<html>
    <head>
        <style>
            html {
                background: red;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
</html>

External CSS:
For multipage projects you should use External CSS.
This means there's a indipendent file normally called "style.css". In the styles.css sheet you would have things such as:
html{
    background: green
}

Then in the index.html file you'd use a new <link> tag (which is self closing) to apply to styling.
Eg:
<html>
    <head>
        <link 
            rel="stylesheet"      -This is the relationship, what is the role of this thing we're linking to.
            href="./style.css"   -Where is the thing we're linking to stored?
        />
    </head>
</html>
